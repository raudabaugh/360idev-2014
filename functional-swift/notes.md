Functional Swift - [Chris Eidhof](http://twitter.com/chriseidhof)
================

* 3 examples

Core Image
----------
* Framework for manipulating images (applying filters)
* The Objective-C way is not very typed
* Function passing makes it easier to apply multiple filters (blur, color overlay)
* Function composition operator |>

Diagrams
--------
* Drawing shapes with Core Graphics (e.g. CGContextFill)
* The Objective-C way is very procedural and requires state setup
* Swift lets your code describe what you want to do moreso than how to do it (subtle difference)
* Use recursion to draw aligned diagrams

JSON
----
* Nested if-statements can be flattened with mapping, apply, currying
