Onboarding and First Impressions - [Ben Johnson](http://twitter.com/scoober)
================================

Things to Avoid
---------------
* Digital Lines (e.g. Mailbox invite)
* Too much of a "dress rehearsal" (onboarding) for a "dinner party" (simple) app
* 6 intro swipe screens with no skip button!
* Overlays - taking picture of the app and draw on top of it (e.g. Zappos)

Dress Rehearsal
---------------
* For complex apps, the dress rehearsal is a must
* Use empty states - drop notes, calendar events, table view data that explains the app (e.g.
Vesper, Simplenote)
* Tooltips (e.g. Yahoo News "swipe" text over image)

Onboarding Examples
-------------------
* NPR One (good)
* ChitChat (bad)
* iTunes U (ugly)
