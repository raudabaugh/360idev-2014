App Prototyping 101 - [Jay Thrash](http://twitter.com/jaythrash)
===================

Purpose
-------
Prototypes lead to great apps, skipping this step and going straight to code leads to 
developing things that may not actually be needed, and the final work will not be 
representative of what you had in mind.  

You can start injecting this loop even in existing projects:  

Create prototypes -> collect feedback -> validate -> create prototypes

### Sketching  
"Sketching isn't about being a good artist, but about being a good thinker." - Jason Santa Maa  

Tools- regular paper or "N-Up" Templates. Fancy sketchbooks with grids can be helpful but also
intimidating. Pens (sharpie, black and red, shading marker for modal dialogs). Drafting dots,
post-its for popups.

#### Role  
Problem solve and externalize your thinking. Share knowledge with team.

#### Skills 
1. Use your arm, not your wrist.
2. Rotate the page.
3. Keep it simple.
4. Minimize embellishments. Color, shading, detail - use these sparingly to draw attention.

#### Technique  
First half of process should consist of divergent sketching (get as many ideas as possible onto
the page). This leads to convergent sketching - picking the best elements from each.

Have Speed Sketch Sessions where Quantity > Quality. Specific challenge: "How do we...?"

5-10 minutes sketching, 1 minute pitching, 1 minute assessing. Asking questions without
criticizing -> "Why did you include that element", not "That shouldn't be there!"  

Refine and repeat.  

Have a sketch board out in the open, not stashed in a folder, to keep a historical record of
the design process. Preferably mobile to take into various conference rooms for example.

### Interaction Prototyping  

Good for specific things that happen like animations for tapping a button, delete actions, etc.

### Quartz Composer  

Visual programming tool, wiring patches together. Think circuit boards or LabVIEW. Cumbersome
to use for app prototyping until Origami was introduced.

Origami introduces a shared vocabulary
for your team to describe your compositions (e.g. scrolling actions).

Macro patches have square edges and can be double-clicked to see containing patches.

### Keynote  

Keynote prototypes are easier to run on the device itself. Nice to check color range, etc.

Note: the iOS app expects to always be in landscape mode.

Used internally at Apple. See [WWDC 2014: App Prototyping - Fake It Til You Make It](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/#223).

More likely that someone has Keynote installed than Quartz Composer.

Set custom slide sizes to device dimensions. Bring in an app screenshot and crank down the 
transparency, using it as trace paper.
